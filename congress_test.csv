"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support",,,,
"of H.R. 3694, the Helping Families Fly",,,,
Act.,,,,
Traveling through the airport can be,,,,
a stressful time for many of our trav-,,,,
elers. Pregnant,women,and families,,
with young children sometimes experi-,,,,
ence more difficulty,,"when traveling,",,
especially during,the,screening,,proc-
ess.,,,,
TSA's current,screening,procedures,,
must be improved to ensure that these,,,,
families are supported,,and have,,an
easier experience flying through Amer-,,,,
ica's airports.,,,,
This bill will improve the screening,,,,
process for pregnant women and their,,,,
families by requiring,,security,,per-
sonnel to undergo training specific to,,,,
the concerns and needs of these specific,,,,
travelers.,,,,
"Additionally,",this,legislation,,re-
quires TSA to increase awareness of se-,,,,
curity procedures,and,guidelines,,by
utilizing various forms of communica-,,,,
tion to keep families informed of the,,,,
different options they may have during,,,,
the screening process.,,This includes,,
"providing passengers,",,"upon request,",,
support specialists for women and fam-,,,,
ilies and adequate opt-out options to,,,,
allow passengers,to,undergo,,alter-
native screening procedures.,,,,
"In short, this bill helps to improve",,,,
TSA operations and support the mil-,,,,
lions of pregnant,women,and,young,
families who travel throughout our Na-,,,,
tion's airports.,,,,

"support of H.R. 3694, the Helping Fami-",,,,
"lies Fly Act, sponsored by my friend",,,,
"and colleague from Arizona, Represent-",,,,
ative LESKO.,,,,
H.R. 3694 requires TSA to implement,,,,
a number of reforms aimed at improv-,,,,
ing the travel experience for pregnant,,,,
women and families with young chil-,,,,
"dren, including specific assistance by",,,,
TSA officers at checkpoints and new,,,,
training for officers.,,,,
Representative LESKO's bill will en-,,,,
sure that TSA,works,closely,,with
transportation stakeholders,,to,,make
pregnant travelers and families aware,,,,
of screening procedures and options for,,,,
assistance.,,,,
This good-government bill recognizes,,,,
that TSA is oftentimes seen as the face,,,,
of the Department of Homeland Secu-,,,,
"rity, screening",more,than 2,million,
"passengers a day. As such, it is incum-",,,,
bent upon the agency,,to ensure,,its
services are working for all travelers.,,,,
H.R. 3694 will improve the passenger,,,,
experience for pregnant,,women,,and
families with young,,children.,I,urge
"my colleagues to support this bill, and",,,,
I reserve the balance of my time.,,,,
"Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I have no",,,,
"more speakers, and I am prepared to",,,,
close after,the,gentleman,from,Ten-
nessee closes.,,,,
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of",,,,

Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-,,,,
"er, I yield",5 minutes,to the,gentle-,
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO).,,,,
"Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank",,,,
the gentleman,,from Tennessee,,for
yielding me the time.,,,,
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong",,,,
support of,my,bipartisan,"legislation,",
"H.R. 3694,",the,Helping Families,,Fly
Act.,,,,
I believe,strongly,that TSA's,,pas-
senger screening checkpoints should be,,,,
a family-friendly,,environment.,,Air-
ports can already be stressful places for,,,,
the traveling,"public,",and that,stress,
can be exacerbated for expecting moth-,,,,
ers or families,,traveling with,young,
children.,,,,
That is why,I,introduced,this,"bill,"
which directs,TSA,to train,frontline,
personnel on how to appropriately ad-,,,,
dress traveler,,concerns,related,to
screening technologies and opt-out pro-,,,,
cedures.,,,,
"Additionally, H.R. 3694 seeks to im-",,,,
prove the passenger screening process,,,,
by increasing the availability of front-,,,,
line TSA personnel and passenger sup-,,,,
port specialists,,for pregnant,women,
and families with young children.,,,,
"Moreover,",my,legislation,requires,
TSA to communicate across its various,,,,
"media platforms,",,and in partnership,,
"with transportation stakeholders, any",,,,
"improvements, procedures, changes, or",,,,
services relevant,,to pregnant,women,
and families with young children.,,,,
"Lastly, H.R. 3694 will examine wheth-",,,,
er certain checkpoints may accommo-,,,,
date dedicated family-friendly screen-,,,,
"ing lanes, which will improve the expe-",,,,
rience for traveling families while also,,,,
improving,the,operation,across,all
checkpoint lanes.,,,,
"Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member",,,,
of the Transportation,,and,Maritime,
"Security Subcommittee, as well as a",,,,
mother and,"grandmother,",,I believe,
that we should,,be holding,TSA,ac-
countable in how it interacts with the,,,,
traveling public and facilitates the effi-,,,,

sengers who are pregnant and traveling,,,,
with young families.,,,,
I thank the chairman of the Trans-,,,,
portation and Maritime Security Sub-,,,,
"committee, Representative CORREA, for",,,,
his bipartisan support of this legisla-,,,,
tion. We don't always have a lot of that,,,,
"here, so I am very thankful that we",,,,
were able to agree on this bill.,,,,
"Additionally,",,I thank,Chairman,
THOMPSON and Ranking Member ROG-,,,,
ERS for their work to bring this bill to,,,,
the floor today and all the bill's co-,,,,

"Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3694",,,,
will improve the traveling experience,,,,
for pregnant women and young families,,,,
traveling throughout our Nation's air-,,,,
ports.,,,,
By improving the awareness and,,,,
"skills of our security personnel, and",,,,
providing more resources and support,,,,

GENERAL LEAVE,,,,
"Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask",,,,
unanimous consent that all Members,,,,
may have 5 legislative days to revise,,,,
and extend their remarks and to in-,,,,
clude extraneous materials on this,,,,
measure.,,,,
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there,,,,
objection to the request of the gen-,,,,
tleman from California?,,,,
There was no objection.,,,,
"Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield",,,,
myself such time as I may consume.,,,,
"Mr. Speaker, every day, in commu-",,,,
"nities across this country, synthetic",,,,
opioids kill Americans in shocking,,,,
numbers. H.R. 3722 will take a step for-,,,,
"ward by addressing this epidemic,",,,,
which is one of the most severe ever,,,,
facing our country.,,,,
"The opioid crisis, having already",,,,
claimed hundreds of thousands of,,,,
American lives over the past two dec-,,,,
"ades, has evolved into a new and even",,,,
more dangerous phase.,,,,
The first periods of the crisis were,,,,
characterized by the overuse of pre-,,,,
scription opioids and heroin. Dev-,,,,
"astating as these stages were, the cur-",,,,
rent phase is even more deadly still.,,,,
Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids,,,,
are coming into our country from lab-,,,,
oratories in China and Mexico and are,,,,
wreaking havoc on communities across,,,,
the entire country. These extremely,,,,
potent chemicals frequently cross our,,,,
borders through legal channels such as,,,,
"international mail facilities, some-",,,,
"times in small packages, and are dif-",,,,
ficult to detect or interdict. The bill,,,,
now before us aims to address part of,,,,
this challenge.,,,,
The Joint Task Force to Combat,,,,
"Opioid Trafficking Act, sponsored by",,,,
"Representative JIM LANGEVIN, passed",,,,
through the House on a voice vote dur-,,,,
ing the 115th Congress before stalling,,,,
"in the Senate. This Congress, the bill,",,,,
"once again, passed out of the Com-",,,,
mittee on Homeland Security with,,,,
unanimous consent.,,,,
The core of this bill will require the,,,,
Department of Homeland Security to,,,,
stand up a joint task force dedicated to,,,,
preventing synthetic opioids from,,,,
reaching our borders. The joint task,,,,
force model allows DHS to ensure that,,,,
the strengths and capabilities of its,,,,
various components are all leveraged,,,,
to maximum effect.,,,,
Steps such as improved screening,,,,
"procedures, greater targeting of sus-",,,,
"picious senders, and better informa-",,,,
tion-sharing processes can all aid our,,,,
law enforcement,agencies,in,halting,
the ongoing flow of synthetic opioids,,,,
across our borders.,,,,
Unlike the existing,authority,,gov-,
"erning DHS joint task forces, this bill",,,,
will allow DHS and the private sector,,,,
the opportunity to collaborate on this,,,,
challenge. Private-sector partners also,,,,
have strengths and,capabilities,,that,
can greatly enhance,joint,efforts,to,
prevent legitimate commercial activi-,,,,
ties from being exploited by bad actors.,,,,
The crisis at hand requires innova-,,,,
tive solutions. A greater focus on in-,,,,
"creased collaboration between DHS, its",,,,
"components, and",private-sector,,part-,
ners all could go a long way in address-,,,,
ing a major driver of this crisis.,,,,
"Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-",,,,
"leagues to support this legislation, and",,,,
I reserve the balance of my time.,,,,
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-,,,,
"er, I yield myself such time as I may",,,,
"consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in",,,,
support of H.R. 3722.,,,,
The opioid epidemic,continues,,to,
devastate communities across this Na-,,,,
tion. Approximately 115 Americans die,,,,
every single day from an opioid over-,,,,
dose. Opioid abuse,doesn't,discrimi-,,
nate. It touches people from every age,,,,
"group, race, class, gender, background,",,,,
and economic status.,,,,
b,1430,,,
Some Americans,become,addicted,,
after taking doctor-prescribed doses for,,,,
"an injury or a surgery, while others try",,,,
them in illicit forms and become de-,,,,
pendent.,,,,
Another disturbing trend we are see-,,,,
ing is illicit drugs,being,laced,with,
"fentanyl, which is 100 times more pow-",,,,
"erful than morphine, frequently lead-",,,,
ing to accidental overdose.,,,,
We have seen estimates,,concluding,,
that more than 2 million of our fellow,,,,
"Americans are addicted to opioids, and,",,,,
"as a physician, I have seen lives dev-",,,,
"astated, families",disrupted,and,often,
destroyed as the,addict's,behavior,,
drives them to horrific acts.,,,,
As we work to,confront,this,epi-,
"demic, we must prevent overprescrip-",,,,
"tion, stop the illicit",flow,into,the,
"United States, and treat those Ameri-",,,,
cans who have become addicted.,,,,
This bill would authorize a joint task,,,,
force within the Department of Home-,,,,
land Security to organize opioid inter-,,,,
diction efforts across multiple compo-,,,,
nents and agencies in a unity-of-effort,,,,
campaign. It would also leverage do-,,,,
mestic and international,partners,,to,
provide a multifaceted,approach,,to,
tackling the issue.,,,,
Most illicit opioids are produced in,,,,
China and smuggled,"by mail,",,where,
vulnerabilities in the postal system are,,,,
exploited. U.S. Customs,and,,Border,
Protection is also,seeing,increased,,
traffic from Mexico with opioids hidden,,,,
in vehicles and cargo entering through,,,,
the U.S. ports.,,,,
The joint task force approach to the,,,,
opioid epidemic is effective because it,,,,
fosters information,sharing,and,ex-,
change between,all relevant,,stake-,
holders to combat the opioid epidemic.,,,,
While there are no quick or easy so-,,,,
"lutions to this epidemic, H.R. 3722 is a",,,,
step in the right direction. I support,,,,
"this bill, and I encourage my col-",,,,
leagues to do the same.,,,,
"Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of",,,,
my time.,,,,
"Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5",,,,
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode,,,,
Island (Mr. LANGEVIN).,,,,
"Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I",,,,
thank the gentleman for yielding.,,,,
"Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.",,,,
"3722, the Joint Task Force to Combat",,,,
Opioid Trafficking Act of 2019.,,,,
"Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a",,,,
public health emergency that has dev-,,,,
astated communities across the coun-,,,,
"try, including in my home State of",,,,
Rhode Island.,,,,
"No matter your race, gender, age, or",,,,
"religion, Americans are suffering from",,,,
"the opioid overdose epidemic. In 2017,",,,,
"approximately 47,600 fatalities were at-",,,,
tributed to opioid overdose.,,,,
Fentanyl is exacerbating the prob-,,,,
"lem. This powerful, synthetic opioid, 25",,,,
to 50 times stronger than heroin and 50,,,,
to 100 times more powerful than mor-,,,,
"phine, caused more than 15 times more",,,,
deaths in 2017 than in 2009.,,,,
The majority of opioids interdicted,,,,
by the United States law enforcement,,,,
agencies are seized at ports of entry. In,,,,
"fact, the southern border accounts for",,,,
at least 75 percent of all opioids col-,,,,
lected.,,,,
I am pleased to offer a solution with,,,,
"my colleagues, Mr. KING from New",,,,
"York, Mr. ROSE, and Mr. MCCAUL, that",,,,
will strengthen the Department of,,,,
Homeland Security's fight against the,,,,
drug crisis.,,,,
This bill authorizes the Secretary of,,,,
Homeland Security to establish a task,,,,
force to enhance the internal integra-,,,,
tion of the Department's border secu-,,,,
"rity operations to detect, interdict, dis-",,,,
"rupt, and prevent narcotics, including",,,,
"fentanyl, from entering the United",,,,
States in the first place.,,,,
Secretary Johnson was the first to,,,,
use the joint task force model to,,,,
achieve better unity of effort across,,,,
the Department's components.,,,,
"All of DHS' many agencies, from Cus-",,,,
toms and Border Protection to the,,,,
"United States Coast Guard, have an",,,,
important role to play when it comes,,,,
to combating opioid trafficking. So if,,,,
the Homeland Security investigations,,,,
are looking into a fentanyl distribution,,,,
"ring, for example, in Omaha, they need",,,,
to coordinate efforts with Customs of-,,,,
fices in El Paso so that packages en,,,,
route to Nebraska are properly inter-,,,,
dicted.,,,,
The JTF model is intended to ensure,,,,
this coordination is baked into the cul-,,,,
ture of DHS so that cases don't slip,,,,
through the cracks. Congress recog-,,,,
nized the value of Secretary Johnson's,,,,
pilot JTFs when we formally author-,,,,
ized them in 2016.,,,,
As new challenges confront the De-,,,,
"partment, we must make use of this or-",,,,
ganizational structure in innovative,,,,
ways to maintain the synergies that,,,,
drove the creation of DHS in the first,,,,
place.,,,,
Stopping proliferation of fentanyl is,,,,
particularly well-suited to the JTF ap-,,,,
proach. Unlike many more traditional,,,,
"narcotics, fentanyl is often shipped di-",,,,
rectly to dealers from overseas.,,,,
Fentanyl's extremely high potency al-,,,,
lows these shipments to be small,,,,
enough to go undetected unless care-,,,,
fully scrutinized. That is why it is es-,,,,
sential that the joint task force on,,,,
opioids collaborate with private-sector,,,,
"organizations and any other Federal,",,,,
"State, local, Tribal, territorial, or",,,,
international entity to increase oper-,,,,
"ational effectiveness, coordination, and",,,,
information sharing.,,,,
"We need to work with partners, espe-",,,,
cially the United States Postal Service,,,,
and private parcel delivery services,,,,
like UPS and FedEx to ensure sus-,,,,
picious packages are inspected. Having,,,,
a single task force coordinating the De-,,,,
partment's efforts makes it much easi-,,,,
er for other organizations to know,,,,
whom to call.,,,,
"So this crisis gripping our Nation is,",,,,
"obviously, very complex. We cannot",,,,
succeed in stemming the opioid epi-,,,,
demic unless the Federal Government,,,,
recognizes the opportunity to integrate,,,,
and collaborate—not only across agen-,,,,
"cies, but also with our private-sector",,,,
partners.,,,,
So like every bill that makes its way,,,,
"to the floor, this legislation is a result,",,,,
"of course, of a collaborative effort. I",,,,
have to begin by thanking former Sen-,,,,
"ator Claire McCaskill, who has been a",,,,
true championship in driving policy to,,,,
address the opioid crisis and who first,,,,
proposed applying the JTF model to,,,,
this epidemic.,,,,
"I must also thank my good friend,",,,,
"longtime colleague on the committee,",,,,
"and cosponsor, Congressman PETER",,,,
"KING, who is helping ensure that this",,,,
"effort is a bipartisan one; Mr. MCCAUL,",,,,
who helped get this bill to the last Con-,,,,
"gress; and, of course, Mr. ROSE, who",,,,
has been a real champion in helping to,,,,
combat the opioid crisis and who has,,,,
had an immediate impact fighting,,,,
opioids since he came to Congress ear-,,,,
lier this year.,,,,
I am grateful also to Chairman,,,,
THOMPSON for his continued leadership,,,,
on using all of the powers of DHS to,,,,
combat this epidemic.,,,,
"Like anything we do, nothing would",,,,
"have been possible, of course, without",,,,
"tireless staff work, and particularly",,,,
that of Rosaline Cohen and Alex Carnes,,,,
with the committee; my legislative di-,,,,
"rector, Nick Leiserson; and also Elyssa",,,,
"Malin, a former staffer in my office.",,,,
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The,,,,
time of the gentleman has expired.,,,,
"Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield an",,,,
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman,,,,
from Rhode Island.,,,,
"Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I",,,,
thank the gentleman for yielding me,,,,
the additional time.,,,,
"As I said before, the opioid epidemic",,,,
"is increasingly complex, with a number",,,,
of factors driving the tragic increases,,,,
in overdose. There is no silver bullet;,,,,
"rather, we need a whole-of-society ap-",,,,
proach. This bill will bring that unity,,,,
of effort to the Department of Home-,,,,
land Security so that it can be a more,,,,
effective partner in turning the tide,,,,
against opioid abuse.,,,,
I hope all of my colleagues will join,,,,
me in supporting the creation of a joint,,,,
task force on opioids and support this,,,,
bill.,,,,
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-,,,,
"er, I have no further speakers for the",,,,
"bill. I renew my support, and I yield",,,,
back the balance of my time.,,,,
"Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield",,,,
myself such time as I may consume.,,,,
"Mr. Speaker, our country faces a se-",,,,
"vere and ongoing crisis, with newly de-",,,,
veloped synthetic opioids causing tre-,,,,
"mendous suffering to our families, indi-",,,,
"viduals, and entire communities",,,,
throughout the country. The collabora-,,,,
tion between private companies and,,,,
the government that will be possible,,,,
through this legislation will prove to,,,,
be a crucial component in the task of,,,,
stopping the flow of fentanyl across,,,,
our borders.,,,,
